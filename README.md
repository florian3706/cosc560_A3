## Report

ℹ️ The link to this assignment in my GitHub can be found at the very top of the document above the title.

### Setup

- Clone git repo and move to the feature branch: `git checkout assignment_3`
- Move into app folder `cd assignment_3`
- Run `npm start` or `npm run build`

### Postman collection

I am providing two files, as Postman gave me two formats to choose from: v2 and v2.1. The files are named `v2_Assignment_3.postman_collection.json` and `v2-1_Assignment_3.postman_collection.json` respectively.
